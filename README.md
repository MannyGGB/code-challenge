# Implement and build a designed component

## Approach

1. First, I like to set up a reset.css
2. When building the HTML elements, I try to identify how elements are nested going from the outside to the inside.
3. When I have identified the elements, I tend to use HTML semantic tags as much as possible to avoid unnecessary classes and to target the elements easier in the style file.
4. In the style file, I like having variables and imports at the top for properties that will affect the whole body, for example, the font.
5. Once I target an element, I try to use the box model to list the properties starting from the outside to the inside as much as possible.
